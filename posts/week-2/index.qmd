Slides:
[Week 2 Slides](https://robertwwalker.github.io/xaringan/CWD-Week-2/index.html)

Readings:

-   RMarkdown Driven Development

Though written about RMarkdown, the same general principles apply to quarto.  Emily Riederer has an excellent blog post describing RDD [RMarkdown Driven Development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/).

-   On Git

Jenny Bryan has an excellent, though dated, extended treatment of Git. It was distilled into a shorter article, [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/)

The [longer version is here](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)

![What is it?](img/Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 2.32.57 PM.png)
That's for software developers.  Why is it an ideal tool for data science and data projects?

One of the most important ideas when collaborating: [merge versus rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

[It has a golden rule.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing)

## Key Tips

- Thinking through `.gitignore`

The `usethis` package and `usethis::git_vaccinate()`

- Primary data security through adding `data/` to `.gitignore`.

## Two supplemental topics:

1. [How to Read R Help](https://rfortherestofus.com/2022/10/help-pages/)

2. [RMarkdown Driven Development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/)

# Homework

The second assignment is individual.  Here is what I want you to do.  

1. Some preparation.

Have a look at a few sites built via each approach.  I have examples, no claim that they are good, in

- `blogdown` using hugo [Allison Presmanes-Hill gave great talk on this to the PDX R-Users group](https://apreshill.github.io/blogdown-workshop/)
   + [my academic website: rww.science](https://rww.science) and 
   + [my blog](https://rww-science.website)

- `quarto`
   + [ESSSSDA Panel Data Course](https://essssda22-3k.netlify.app/)
   + [DADM-FAQ](https://robertwwalker.github.io/DADM-FAQ/)

I do not have examples in `distill`.  I would point you to the RStudio examples.  [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) and [update](https://posit.co/blog/distill/).  Also, [Thomas Mock has a really nice example on the MockUp](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/).

**Deliverable: an email containing the URL.  You should also post a link to it in the Portfolios thread so that others can have a look at what you have done.  For now just a working template is sufficient though you should at least customize whatever you start with.**
