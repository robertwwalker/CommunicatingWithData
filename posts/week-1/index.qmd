Meeting Date: January 9, 2023

Following the presentation of an overview of the general plan for the course and our establishment of familiarity with one another, I will focus on three major topics for today, one leading into our next meeting in two weeks time (January 23, 2023).

1. An Overview
2. Introductions, skills, and background
3. On Empathy and Argumentation
4. Git and version control

Readings:

-   An approach to argumentation

`Kneupper, C. W. (1978). Teaching Argument: An Introduction to the Toulmin Model. College Composition and Communication, 29(3), 237â€“241. https://doi.org/10.2307/356935`

A .pdf is available on WISE.

-   On Git

Jenny Bryan has an excellent, though dated, extended treatment of Git. It was distilled into a shorter article, [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/)
